"AI Memory Controller - For important things, that actually need to be completed and not dumped because a context window was exceeded. For problems that actually need to be solved."

**Tagline**: *"For important things that actually need to be completed. For problems that actually need to be solved."*

We believe:
- Your conversations are your intellectual property.
- Memory should be sovereign, not rented.
- Simplicity is a feature, not a compromise.
- No single company should own your cognitive history.

We are building the universal memory layer because
the alternative is a future of forgetful assistants
and knowledge locked in silos.

This is the missing piece that makes AI truly useful.
For important things that actually need to be completed.
For problems that actually need to be solved.
